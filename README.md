# ExerciseDetection

Real-time exercise classification and rep counting from webcam video using pose estimation and a trained neural network.

## What it does

- Detects your body pose every frame using MediaPipe
- Classifies what exercise you're doing (pushup, squat, pullup, jumping jack, or rest) in real time
- Counts reps automatically using a per-exercise angle-based state machine
- Displays exercise label, confidence %, rep count, and FPS as an overlay on the webcam feed

## How it works

The pipeline has three phases:

```
collect.py  →  train.py  →  app.py
```

**collect.py** — records labeled training data. Opens your webcam (or a video file), runs pose detection on each frame, and saves 30-frame sliding windows of normalized landmarks to CSV files.

**train.py** — trains the classifier offline. Loads all CSVs, fits a `StandardScaler` + `MLPClassifier` (256→128 hidden layers), evaluates on a held-out 20% test set, and saves `model.pkl` + `scaler.pkl` to `models/`.

**app.py** — runs live inference. Opens your webcam, fills a 30-frame buffer of landmarks, classifies the buffer every frame, and feeds the prediction into the rep counter.

## Exercises supported

| Exercise | Camera orientation |
|---|---|
| Pushup | Side profile |
| Squat | Side profile |
| Pullup | Front or back facing |
| Jumping jack | Facing forward |
| Rest | Any |

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the MediaPipe pose model and place it in the project root:

```
pose_landmarker_lite.task
```

## Usage

### 1. Collect training data

Run once per exercise label. Press **SPACE** to start/stop recording, **Q** to quit and save.

```bash
python src/collect.py --exercise pushup
python src/collect.py --exercise squat
python src/collect.py --exercise pullup
python src/collect.py --exercise jumping_jack
python src/collect.py --exercise rest
```

Or collect from a video file:

```bash
python src/collect.py --exercise pushup --video data/videos/pushup.mp4
python src/collect.py --exercise pullup --video data/videos/pullup.mp4 --start 60 --end 90
```

Collected windows are saved to `data/raw/` as timestamped CSVs.

### 2. Train the model

```bash
python src/train.py
```

Prints a per-class classification report and confusion matrix. Results are also saved to `models/report.txt`. Target accuracy: >85%.

### 3. Run the live app

```bash
python src/app.py
```

Stand in front of your webcam. The overlay shows:
- **Top left** — predicted exercise + confidence score (how certain the model is)
- **Top right** — rep count
- **Bottom left** — FPS

Press **Q** to quit.

## Running tests

```bash
.venv/bin/pytest tests/ -v
```

22 tests covering landmark normalization, rep counter state machine, data collection, and training pipeline.
